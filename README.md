# advanced bash notes :taco:


# linux is extensionless
.txt means nothing
commands are case sensitive

-c : characters
-w : words
-l : line
## Everything is a file
. is a file
txt.txt is a file
directory_folder/ is a file


## Linux Permission

Things users can do:
Read(r)
Write(w)
Execute(x)

Users that exist:
- owner : Typically the person user who created the file. However, it can be changed
- group : Every file belongs to a single group. Groups have many users in it
- others : Everyone else not in a group or the owner


## Changing Permissions:

    chmod <permission> <path/file> -- without the brackets

## streams, redirects and piping
### streams
std -- standard
- STDIN
  - standard input
  - std code is 0
- STDOUT
  - standard output
  - std code is 1
- STDERR
  - standard Error'
  l,
  - std code is 2

### Piping and redirects
Means we can join all these amazing command together :)

### Redirecting
### This is redirecting  of STDOUT
la > list_of_ls.tx

wc words.txt > word_count.txt

cat words.txt >> word_count.txt


### THis is redirecting of STDIN

wc < words.txt


### Redirecting STDDERR

ls non_file_existing 2> log.txt

### Piping |
We sent STDOUT and STDERR into files, but what we want is to be able to send outputs
into other programs. This is very powerful and is called piping


ls | head -3
ls | tail -2     :
ls | grep exa    : searches for exa int the list


running the instance of a programme is called a process


### process Management

ps

ps aux : for all the processes

ps aux | grep aux > ps_aux_logs.txt

ps aux | grep vagrant > ps_vagrant_logs.txt

ps aux | vagrant nwejf 231 2>> ps_vagrant_logerrors.txt
